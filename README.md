# PyCitySchools
Using two excel spreedsheets of district-wide standardized test results for Py City Schools I have aggregated the data to showcase obvious trends in school performance.

The notebook includes each the following
1. District Summary
2. School Summary
3. Top Performing Schools (By Passing Rate)
4. Bottom Performing Schools (By Passing Rate)
5. Math Scores by Grade
6. Reading Scores by Grade
7. Scores by School Spending, average Spending Ranges (Per Student)
8. Scores by School Size (Small, Medium, Large).
9. Scores by School Type (Charter vs. District)
