The notebook includes the following

2. School Summary
3. Top Performing Schools (By Passing Rate)
4. Bottom Performing Schools (By Passing Rate)
5. Math Scores by Grade
6. Reading Scores by Grade
7. Scores by School Spending (Average Per Student Spending Range)

9. Scores by School Type (Charter vs. District)
